TODO:\
1: Make more insecure (enable generic command execution)\
2: Align better with design specifications (this was supposed to be an SSH client, why did I want to do that again? Is that still necessary?)\
3: Create client (XTerm integration, Security Vulnerability is not user-friendly enough)\
4: Add security (optional)
